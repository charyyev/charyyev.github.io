I am a Computer Science master's student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/de.html), Switzerland. 
I wrote my master's thesis on efficient multimodal environment representation for robot navigation. I proposed efficient multimodal architecture and self-supervised learning method to improve perception tasks for navigation.
My interest in computer vision started in my undergraduate where I worked as a research assistant at [AI, Robotics and Transportation lab](https://chiuau.github.io/) on autonomous drone racing.
After graduation, I worked at companies [Seoul Robotics](https://seoulrobotics.tech/) as machine learning research engineer and [STPC](http://ar247.co.kr/) as perception engineer.
