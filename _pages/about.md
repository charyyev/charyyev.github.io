I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/de.html), Switzerland, specializing in robotics and computer vision. My master’s thesis focuses on developing efficient multimodal environment representations for robot navigation, where I designed a novel architecture and self-supervised learning method to enhance perception tasks.

My passion for computer vision began during my undergraduate studies, where I worked as a research assistant at the [AI, Robotics and Transportation lab](https://chiuau.github.io/), contributing to autonomous drone racing research. After graduation, I gained industry experience as a Machine Learning Research Engineer Intern at [Seoul Robotics](https://seoulrobotics.tech/) and as a Perception Engineer at [STPC](http://ar247.co.kr/), where I further honed my expertise in cutting-edge perception technologies.
